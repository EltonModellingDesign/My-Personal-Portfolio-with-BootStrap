# My-Personal-Portfolio-with-BootStrap
It's my first project with BootStrap, I wanted to create an optmize web site without CSS and JavaScript file. 
Well I just used a little bit CSS It didn't get perfect in some points but next time I would like to create an easy visualization for my 3D and Design imagens 
using carrosel, you can see in the comments in the script that I tried made something similar, but I can't use carrousel more than twice from bootstrap 
in diferent portfolio imagens. 

But I sharped my skills in BootStrap and for who wants to create something similar or even take my code to build yours.  One detail its in portuguese

When you download the archiev, first unpack with Winrar and after that, Unpack also the file Projects to have access to my programming projects by the page
and you can execute the HTML file(MeuPortflioIndex) and I recommend execute using Visual Studios for better performance.
